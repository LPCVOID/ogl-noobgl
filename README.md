# ogl-noobgl
My second OGL Engine. Supports Shadowmapping/Phong Lightning/Terrain rendering. OGL 3.1 Core.

# Features
Pretty basic, as it was initially only for some simulation tasks at my old employer.

* Material file format that describes shaders and texture
* Complete Scene graph with world/local transform support 
* Simple shadowmapping engine 
* Mathematically correct directional/ambient lightning
* Support for meshes in own ngl format designed to be loaded quickly
* Basic terrain rendering
* Arcball/Freefloat Camera system
* Optimization such as Oriented Bounding Boxes for Meshes and Terrain blocks
* ...And some other stuff

I hope you have fun with this. I know the code is pretty crappy at some points.

# Plans
Probably none. If I get back into OpenGL, I will probably write a new engine as I have learned a bit more about software architecture now.

# Notes

Requires my rax framework to compile, which is in another repository of mine.
